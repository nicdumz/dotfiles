	Read me V1.4 - 20/7 - 2010
(revised read-me file - License change)

This is the Read me file that comes with the original version of Comfortaa - It does not have to be distributed with any derivative works.

	Thank you for downloading Comfortaa!

If you like Comfortaa and use it, you are very welcome to leave a donation!
Making fonts is much work and even a very small amount of money will be highly appreciated,
encouraging me to keep making fonts available free of charge.  
To make a donation, use the link "donate" included in the comfortaa folder.

(Note that it is entirely up to you if you want to leave a donation, and not doing so should by no means ethically stop you from using Comfortaa)



	To install:

Windows:
Copy the font files to C:\windows\fonts

Mac:
Put the files into /Library/Fonts (for all users),
or into /Users/Your_username/Library/Fonts (for you only).

Linux:
Copy the font files to fonts:// in the File manager


I hope you will enjoy using it.
