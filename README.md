# Notes

I seem to always forget, but I actually quite like the base16 color themes:

- http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#flat
- http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#monokai
- http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#solarized

https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-gnome-terminal is nice and easy for gnome terminal profiles.
